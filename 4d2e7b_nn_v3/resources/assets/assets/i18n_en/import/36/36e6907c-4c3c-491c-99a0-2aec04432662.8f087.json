    The commission on this site is based on valid bets. Let's assume that for this site, the corresponding commission rate for 10-20 thousand is %{rate_10}/10K, and for 3 million and above, the corresponding commission rate is %{rate_300}/10K. A discovers a business opportunity on this site and immediately develops B1, B2, and B3. B1 further develops C1 and C2, B2 has no lower levels, and B3 only develops a more capable C3.\n       A few days later, the valid bets for B1, B2, and B3 and their lower levels are as follows: B1 personally has valid bets of 120,000, B2 personally has valid bets of 40,000, B3 personally has valid bets of 20,000, C1 personally has valid bets of 100,000, C2 personally has valid bets of 30,000, and C3 personally reaches 3 million invalid bets. Consequently, B1's total performance comes from C1 and C2, totaling 130,000, with a corresponding commission rate of %{rate_c1c2}/10K; B2 has no lower-level performance, amounting to 0; B3 has a lower level, C3, contributing to a total performance of 3 million, with a corresponding commission rate of %{rate_300}/10K. A has 180,000 from the direct team and 3,130,000 from other teams, totaling a performance of 3,310,000, with a corresponding commission rate of %{rate_331}/10K.\n       The profit calculation among them is as follows:\n<b>1. Direct Team: </b>refers to the members of vertical development, which are collectively called direct teams.\n<b>(1) B1, B2, B3 Contribution to A: </b>\n(120,000+40,000+20,000)x%{rate_331}/10K=</c><assist_3>%{b_to_a}</c><focus_2>.\n<b>(2) C1 and C2 Contribution to B1: </b>\n(100,000+30,000)x%{rate_c1c2}/10K=<assist_3>%{c_to_b1}</c><focus_2>.\n<b>(3) C3 Contributes to B3: </b>\n3 million x%{rate_300}/10,000=<assist_3>%{c3_to_b3}</c><focus_2>.\n\n<b>2. Other Teams:</b> Refers to lower levels, lower lower levels, and so forth, collectively called other teams. As the system can have an unlimited number of lower levels, for the sake of explanation, this text only considers a 2-level structure as an example.\n<b>(1) From C1 and C2:</b> Since B1's total performance is 130,000, enjoying a %{rate_c1c2}/10K commission rate, and A's total performance is 3,310,000, enjoying a %{rate_331}/10K commission rate, the commission difference between A and B1 is %{rate_331} - %{rate_c1c2} = %{rate_diffe}/10K. This difference is the portion contributed by C1 and C2 to A, so <b>C1 and C2 Contribution to A:</b>\n(100,000+30,000)×%{rate_diffe}/10,000=<assist_3>%{c_to_a}</c><focus_2>.\n<b>(2) From C3: </b>Since B3 has a total performance of 3 million and enjoys a rebate rate of %{rate_300}/10K, while A has a total performance of 3.31 million and also enjoys a rebate rate of %{rate_331}/10K, then the rebate difference between A and B3 is %{rate_331}-%{rate_300}=%{a_c3}/10K. <b>C3 Contributes to A: </b>\n3 million x%{a_c3}/10K=<assist_3>%{c3_to_a}</c><focus_2>.\n\n<b>3. Summary:</b>\n(1)Because C3 is powerful, all of A's performance indirectly enjoys the highest rebate rate.\n(2) B2 might be relatively inactive, thus having no earnings.\n(3) Despite joining relatively late and being in A's lower level, B3, with its lower level C3's strong performance, allows B3 to directly enjoy a higher commission rate. So, regardless of when B3 joins, under whom they are positioned or at what level, the earnings remain unaffected and are not restricted by others' lower levels or developments\n(4) This is an absolutely fair and just agency model, and it will not be trampled on forever because of who joins late. </c>","dljs_tip_one":"<focus_2>For Example: A has developed three members B1, B2, B3 in total, of which,\nB1's valid bet on Card games is 40,000, and the corresponding rebate rate is </c><assist_3>%{rateb1}</c><focus_2>/10k;\nB2's valid bet in Card games is 300,000, and the corresponding rebate rate is </c><assist_3>%{rateb2}</c><focus_2>/10k;\nB3's valid bet on Card games is 80,000, and the corresponding rebate rate is </c><assist_3>%{rateb3}</c><focus_2>/10k;\nThen the benefits brought by the three of them to A are as follows:</c>\n<focus_2>B1 contribution: 40,000x%{rateb1}/10,000=</c><assist_3>%{gxb1}</c>\n<focus_2>B2 contribution: 300,000x%{rateb2}/10,000=</c><assist_3>%{gxb2}</c>\n<focus_2>B3 contribution: 80,000×%{rateb3}/10,000=</c><assist_3>%{gxb3}</c>\n<focus_2>A's total revenue: B1 contributed %{gxb1}+B2 contributed %{gxb2}+B3 contributed %{gxb3}=</c><assist_3>%{all}</c><focus_2>.</c>","dljs_return_one":"<normal_2>Agent Bonus Rate: </c><assist_3>%{num}</color><normal_2>/10K</c>","dljs_b1_to_a_one":"<focus_2>bonus%{str}</c><assist_3>%{num}</color>","gx_account":"Contribution account","gx_commission":"Contribution Commission","xiajirenshu":"Number of Subordinates","zhishu":"Direct","qita":"Other","leiJiZhuanZhang":"Total Trasfer","ZhuanZhang":"Transfer","renShu":"%{value} individuals","more":"More","copyClose":"Copy and close","kaiHuTip":"Please remember or save it properly, you will not be able to get it upon leaving this page.","Intruduction":"World's first 2K HD Card Game\nScan to download","zong_jingyingli":"total net profit","jingyingli":"Net profit","youxiaorenshu":"Valid members","leijicunkuan":"Total deposit","weidabiao":"not reach target","fanyong_tip":"Valid members: Users with deposits of %{num} or above are considered as valid users.","jyl_b_to_a":"<normal_2>Deposit</c><focus_2> %{num1}</c><br/><normal_2>Contribution</c><focus_2> %{num2}</c><br/><normal_2>Promotional Benefits Received</c><focus_2> %{num3}</c><br/><normal_2>net profit</c><focus_2> %{num4}</c>","dljs_tip_jyl":"<focus_2>For example A has developed a total of three members: B1, B2, B3.

Special circumstances:</b> If you are an agent on the first day or have no performance on the previous day, you will still enjoy commissions for the first deposit, recharge and valid bets, but the rebate ratio will be calculated at the lowest level. <br><b>4.

In order to prevent bad debts or malicious consumption, the club needs to pay a certain deposit before it can be opened. The deposit determines the bill amount and the amount of third-party games that can be brought in (except for WG native games and club games, which are not subject to the limit). Therefore, the more deposits paid, the greater the amount that can be brought into third-party games; and the corresponding deposit will be automatically deducted after the bill is settled, so a deposit must be recharged from time to time to ensure the normal operation of the club. <b>Calculation formula: Club deposit = unsettled bills + (three parties that can be brought in + three parties that have been brought in) / 10.</b></p>\n<p>　　<b>Example</b>: A club has paid a deposit of 5,000, and the current unsettled bill is 1,000. The ratio of the deposit and the third-party game brought in is 10. Then the third-party game has been brought in and the maximum amount that can be brought into the third-party game is: (5000-1000)*10 = 40,000. </p>","takedthird_des":"<b>　　Amount brought into third-party games</b> refers to the total funds brought by all club members into third-party games (excluding WG native games and club games). <b>Formula: Amount brought into third-party games = A member's balance + B member's balance + ... + N member's balance</b>\n\n　　<b>Example</b>: A club has members A, B, and C.

The current total amount that the club can bring into the third-party game is: ((500-100)*10)-100 = 3900, that is, members B and C can bring a maximum balance of 3900 to a third party for gaming in the future.\n","occupied_des":"<p>　　Refers to <b>occupied margin</b>, which is the sum of the currently unsettled bills and the occupied margins brought into third-party games (including WG Sports) (that is, the margin that cannot be directly withdrawn at present). <b>Calculation formula: Occupied deposit = Unsettled bill + Third party brought in/Margin and third party game brought in ratio multiple. </b></p>\n\n<p>　　<b>For example:</b> A club has paid a deposit of 500.

The bigger the limit for a single member to enter third-party games is not the better, but based on the actual needs of the club to prevent a single member from occupying the entire club's three-party game quota, affecting the experience of other members. 2. After members finish playing third-party games, they must be reminded to return to the lobby normally to release their quota, so as to avoid abnormal exits midway and continue to occupy the quota.\n\n<p>　　<b>Example:</b> The current balance of a member of Club A is 1,000, and the member’s maximum bring-in of three-party games is 600 (assuming the club has sufficient available margin), and the ratio of the margin to third-party games is 10. Then member A can only bring up to 600 to third-party games (the remaining 400 is left in the lobby); if the club's current available deposit is 30 (that is, the entire club can only bring 300 into third-party games), then member A can only bring up to 300 to third-party games (the remaining 700 is left in the lobby). </p>","loan_total_des":"<p>　　Refers to the <b>total loan limit a club can lend to its members</b>.

In order to prevent bad debts or malicious consumption, the club needs to pay a certain deposit before it can be opened. The deposit determines the bill amount and the amount of third-party games that can be brought in (except for WG native games and club games, which are not subject to the limit). Therefore, the more deposits paid, the greater the amount that can be brought into third-party games; and the corresponding deposit will be automatically deducted after the bill is settled, so a deposit must be recharged from time to time to ensure the normal operation of the club. <b>Calculation formula: Club deposit = unsettled bills + (three parties that can be brought in + three parties that have been brought in) / 10.</b></p>\n<p>　　<b>Example</b>: A club has paid a deposit of 5000, and the current unsettled bill is 1,000. The ratio of the deposit and the third-party game brought in is 10. Then the third-party game has been brought in and the maximum amount that can be brought into the third-party game is: (5000-1000)*10 = 40000. </p>"},"rn_common":{"uploadErrorFileSize":"File size not supported","multiterminaltips_2":"<p>This account is currently playing games on the <b>(%{deviceModel})</b>device.
